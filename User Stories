 - As a user I want to be messaged in a DM by DDB (destiny discord buddy) when ADA or Banshee has a MOD for sale that I don't currently own in a single summary message for the day after daily reset.
 - As a user I want to be able to ask DBB for a list of mods I don't own and will be reminded about.
 - As a user I want to be able to configure an "important" list of mods I want to be notified on more aggressivly.
 - As a user I want to be able to configure an "ignore" list of mods I don't care about even if I don't have them.
